/**
 * A class representation of a piece of the Torrent content.
 * Each piece except the final one has a length equal to the
 * value specified by the 'piece length' attribute in the
 * Torrent file.
 * A piece is what is defined in the torrent meta-data. However,
 * when sharing data between peers a smaller unit is used - this
 * smaller piece is refereed to as `Block` by the unofficial
 * specification.
 * The implementation is based on the Python code from the
 * following repository:
